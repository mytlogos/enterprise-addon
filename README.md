# Enterprise

Enterprise is a cross-browser [web extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions).
It is tested in Firefox and Chrome.

To use the services of Enterprise, an user is required to log in/sign up.

The Enterprise-Extension is now downsized to only send Bookmarks to Server to register them as ToC if possible
or mark let the User mark a Release, if associated with the current Tab, as read with a Shortcut.
