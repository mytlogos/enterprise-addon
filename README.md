Enterprise is a cross-browser [web extension](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions).
It is tested in Firefox and Chrome.

To use the services of Enterprise, an user is required to log in/sign up.

The Enterprise-Extension passively gathers data on any Website it is enabled, 
about what has been read, watched or heard.
This data encompasses the title, name of medium if any, part(volume) of the medium if any and the current progress.
After analyzing and gathering data, it displays the current data about the current site, where the user can correct
each data with a click & select.

Finalized Data is send to the [server](https://github.com/mytlogos/enterprise-lister), where it is saved for the
current user.
